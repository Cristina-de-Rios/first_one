							Have you ever imagined a character that combines the sharpness and strength of Samuel Beckett with the rebelliousness and style of Paul Simonon? Well, there you go.

						<div id="panel2b" class="content">
							Old-school retail is full of intermediations and each of them adds extra costs to the product. Don’t get us wrong, we know they have to pay their bills and the process of marketing and distributing a product is expensive. We just feel that there are shorter and more efficient paths to get a product from the factory floor to you. We believe in looking like a gent while saving some serious bucks.

						<a href="#panel3b"><h4>How can you keep your prices so low without sacrificing quality?</h4></a>
						<div id="panel3b" class="content">
							After working in the industry for many years, we’ve learned that the best way to offer fair prices is by making the supply chain as efficient as possible. We don’t spare any details when it comes to production and materials, what you get are the best leathers and the best constructions available. What’s the catch? We avoid unnecessary costs that end up increasing the final price. We don’t invest in marketing nor inventory. Reducing these two expenses allows us to 1) reduce the prices to even half that of other direct-to-consumer brands and 2) give the best value to all of our supporters.

						<div id="panel8c" class="content">
							<p>Taking good care of your shoes is a no brainer, they´ll last longer and you’ll look sharper.</p>
							<p>For smooth leather, brush well once a week to remove any dust and dirt. You can wet the brush to clean the welt if needed. Since leather is a natural material it can dry out, just like your skin. To prevent this, use a cream-based conditioner once in a while, apply a small amount with a damp cloth and rub in circles. This is virtuous enough; you should be admired if you make this a ritual. Anyway, if you want to go further you can use a neutral polish and finish with a polish brush if some extra shine is desired.</p>
							<p>For suede or nubuck leather, the best thing you can do is to spray them generously with a protective spray before the first wear. This will repel water and prevent dirt stains over time; Repeat at least twice a month. For heavy stains, rub with a suede/nubuck cleaning gum and then raise the nap with a brush. If you feel like really going the extra mile, you can also raise the nap holding your shoes over a steaming pot of water.</p>

					<dd class="accordion-navigation">
						<a href="#panel9c"><h4>Are shoe-trees really necessary?</h4></a>
						<div id="panel9c" class="content">
							They are not strictly necessary but can be helpful in several ways. The use of shoetrees prevents deep creases and will absorb humidity. This eliminates odors and make the original shape of the shoes last longer. Plus, some women have reported that it’s a turn on when they see such an act of manliness.
